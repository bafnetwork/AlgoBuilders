Algorand Foundation in partnership with Blockchain Accleration Foundation has funded a student-led capstone project. 
Much of our work is inspired by the original QF paper: https://www.wtfisqf.com/

## The Project
Quadratic Funding (QF) represents a democratized way to allocate funds for public goods based on the community's preferences. This whitepaper aims to design and articulate the process of implementing a QF platform on the Algorand blockchain. The materials and references from various GitHub repositories and articles have been employed to produce a detailed, comprehensive solution tailored to the Algorand ecosystem.
